# wedding-website-vue

My wedding website, built with Vue using Buefy. Shamelessly visually adapted from [rampatra's wedding website](https://github.com/rampatra/wedding-website) with some minor modifications. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXFqkEcMkT8) in the video background section was shot by [Rhys McIntyre Videography LLC](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXHmqIWniKmHLdX4tBHDQnw). Generally the code's a bit of a mess, but it works.
